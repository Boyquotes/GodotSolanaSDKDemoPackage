Gm, Godot game developer!

This repository is a Demo Package of the Solana Godot SDK, which we are working on together with Virus-Axel.
The main repository, containing libs and backend code can be found here: https://github.com/Virus-Axel/godot-solana-sdk 

It is open source, so everyone can help out as we progress.

Test out the latest demo version in your browser: https://zenrepublic.github.io/GodotSolanaSDKDemos/

Current features:
- RPC API support, so you can fetch information on accounts, like their SOL balances and much more
- System Program, allowing you to do transactions of SOL to another address
- Token Program, allowing you to mint new SPL tokens and send them to other addresses
- NFT fetching and parsing images/metadata. (GIFs supported soon, we almost have that working)
- Dynamically Loading 3D NFTs as GLBs
- Wallet adapter. Currently supporting Phantom, Solflare and Backpack. Ultimate coming soon
- Candymachine v3 minting (pNFTs and Candy guard groups supported)

Coming Soon:
- Parsing Anchor Solana program IDL into GDScript

Godot 4.1+ needed to run the project. Windows, Mac and Linux supported.
